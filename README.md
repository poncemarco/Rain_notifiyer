# Rain_notifiyer
This rep contains a code that sends you an SMS to your number if that current day will rain. I use requests and twilio libraries to do it.  You need to get an account in openweather.org and twilio.com to work.  Both have a free count option. 

First, you need to change the latitud and longitude constants to your own location coords. 
And set your own API credentials
