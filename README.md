# Rain_notifiyer
This rep contains a code that sends you an SMS to your number if that current day will rain. I use requests and twilio libraries to do it.  You need to get an account in openweather.org and twilio.com to work.  Both have a free count option. 

First, you need to change the latitud and longitude constants to your own location coords. 
And set your own API credentials. 

If you need to test the code. You may look for a city in the world where it's raining. This website will help you (:
